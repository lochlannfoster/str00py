your previous prompt:

Thank you for the clarification. I'll revise the key points based on your feedback:
Challenge Generation Specifications
1. Color Selection Rules
   * Unique Constraint: Each of the 9 buttons must use a unique combination of text and ink color
   * Correct Answer Button:
      * Text color must accurately represent the correct color
      * This ensures the user can deterministically solve the challenge
   * Remaining Buttons:
      * Intentionally misleading text and ink color combinations
      * No repeated color usages across the 9 buttons
2. Feedback Mechanism
   * Incorrect Answer:
      * No persistent visual or audio feedback
      * Simply regenerate a new challenge
   * Correct Answer:
      * Momentary background color change (1 second)
      * Gracefully close the lock screen
      * Allow access to the previously locked app
Implementing this approach requires a sophisticated color allocation algorithm that:
* Ensures the correct answer is clearly identifiable
* Prevents color repetition
* Maintains the cognitive challenge of the Stroop test
