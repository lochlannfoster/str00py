Here's some user stories that hopefully better describes the app's functioning

"Precise Sequencing: How exactly does the user progress through the Stroop challenge?"
- The user progresses through the stroop challenge by identifying the colour of the primary challenge prompt (e.g. the word "Red" in "Blue" color), and then selecting that colour's name (Blue) which is displayed in a misleading colour (e.g. Yellow) on one of the 9 answer buttons.
- There are 8 decoy buttons, and one correct answer.
- There should be a random colour and name assigned to each button.
- The primary challenge colour should never match the correct answer button font colour, we only want to be matching the primary challenge's with the correct colour name on the buttons. The colour on the buttons is rendered in intentionally misleading colours.

"What triggers the challenge initiation?"
The Primary challenge is initiated when the user selects an app that has been saved/selected to be locked.

"What determines the number and arrangement of color option buttons?"
The only number of answer buttons is always 9.
There will be 8 decoy buttons, and one correct answer.

 How does the user select an answer, and what immediate feedback do they receive?
Let's say the answer is "Blue." The word "Red" will display in blue ink in the primary challenge. The text "Blue" will display in randomly selected ink for the answer button prompt. So when the user taps on the button with the text that reads 'Blue', they will have supplied a correct answer.

In terms of immediate feedback, the answer button's background will change colour, matching the answer button's generated ink colour. Then the lock app is gracefully closed, and access to the locked app is provided.


 "How does the user select an answer, and what immediate feedback do they receive?"
The user selects an answer by processing two stroop tests. e.g. matching the primary challenge text "Red" (displayed in "Blue" color) with the answer button that displays the text "Blue" in an intentionally misleading colour (e.g. "Yellow" color).

 "How are color words and ink colors selected to ensure cognitive challenge?"
 The color words and ink words and associated answers are all generated at random every time the lock screen is initially presented, or when a challenge is failed.
 To aid in cognitive challenge, we should prevent the same answer from appearing on the same button twice in a row. This is so you can't just tap one button and bruteforce your way through the lock.


What rules govern the selection of distractor colors?
The only rule is that e.g. Blue text should never display in Blue ink, the text and ink should always be mismatched.

How is difficulty calibrated (e.g., color similarity, number of options)?
There is no difficulty to be calibrated, there are always the same hard-coded amount of ink colours, colour words, and the correct answer is determined by identifying the primary challenge's ink colour with the answer button's word text.

How are challenges tracked to prevent repetition?
I don't know, I'm hoping you could figure this out. We just need to ensure the correct answer can't display on the same button as an incorrect answer immediately after having failed the challenge.


Immediate Response:

What visual/audio cues indicate a correct or incorrect answer?
The user selects an answer by processing two stroop tests. e.g. matching the primary challenge text "Red" (displayed in "Blue" color) with the answer button that displays the text "Blue" in an intentionally misleading colour (e.g. "Yellow" color).
Additionally, a faint but cheerful trumpet sound plays when the correct answer is given.

Progression Feedback:

How many attempts are allowed before alternative actions are triggered?
What information is communicated about challenge progress?
I'm sorry, can you please elaborate on these points? I don't understand why we need to trigger alternative actions.
I suppose the only information that needs to be communicated is between the challenge prompt (get its ink colour, and colour text) and then ensure that this is communicated with the answer buttons so that the stroop challenge can be successfully completed.

What happens on the first incorrect attempt?
A new challenge is generated.

Are there progressive difficulty increases or penalty mechanisms?
No.

How many retry attempts are permitted?
For now, infinite. Keep regenerating new challenges on an incorrect answer, until a correct answer is displayed, or the user exits the app through the exit button (in which case the app should close gracefully)

What occurs if the user force-closes the challenge?
THat's a good question, I'm hoping you'd be able to suggest something. Maybe preventing the user from force-closing the app should not be allowed in the first place. Do you have any ideas? We should really only let the user exit the challenge screen through the exit button, which should close the lock app gracefully.

Temporal Constraints:
How long is a successful challenge valid?
Until the user closes the app, or switches to another app. Let's keep it simple for now, and maybe we can add a 30 second grace period where the app cannot be locked again.

What defines a "session" for a locked app?
I'm hoping you can help me here, but basically when the app is in-focus the session is active.

How are challenge completions tracked across different apps?
They are not.

What prevents immediate challenge bypass?
I don't know, the logic of the app hopefully. The user can only exit the lock screen without providing a correct answer by clicking the exit button.

How are challenge states maintained during app switches or device interruptions?
Good question, let's opt for generating a new challenge any time these events are deteected.


What is the exact user experience flow from app launch to challenge completion?
For first launch after install:
The user installs the StroopLocker app on their Android device.
The user is guided through an initial setup process to grant all necessary permissions:
The user enables the StroopLocker accessibility service
The user grants "Display over other apps" permission
The user grants device admin privileges
The user selects which apps they want to lock using the app's selection interface.
When the user attempts to open a locked app, StroopLocker detects this via the accessibility service.
The app immediately displays a Stroop challenge over the locked app.
In this challenge, a color word (e.g., "Blue") appears in a different colored text (e.g., red).
The user must select the actual color of the text (not what the word says) from a grid of options.
If incorrect, the user is prompted to try again.
If correct, the challenge is considered completed, and the user is allowed to access the locked app.
The app tracks "sessions" - once a challenge is completed for an app, the user can continue using that app without facing another challenge until they exit the app or switch to another app.
When the user exits the app or switches to a different app and later returns, a new challenge will be presented.
The user can modify their list of locked apps at any time through the main interface.

What is the exact user experience flow from app launch to challenge completion?
For all other launches after the first launch.
The user launches the app.
If the accessibility service is not active, prompt the user with a toast popup that says "Requesting app permissions next time Accessibility is clicked..."
If the strooplocker does not have permission to "DIsplay over other apps", then prompt the user with a toast popup that says "Requesting app permissions next time Accessibility is clicked..."
If the strooplocker does not already have admin privileges, then prompt the user with a toast popup that says "Requesting app permissions next time Accessibility is clicked..."
The user is guided through the complete setup process next time they click accessibility, if the service is not active, strooplocker does not have permission to display over other apps, or it does not have admin priviliges, just then a toast popup that says "Requesting app permissions next time Accessibility is clicked..." is clicked.
The user selects which apps they want to lock using the app's selection interface.
When the user attempts to open a locked app, StroopLocker detects this via the accessibility service.
The app immediately displays a Stroop challenge over the locked app.
In this challenge, a color word (e.g., "Blue") appears in a different colored text (e.g., red).
The user must select the actual color of the text (not what the word says) from a grid of options.
If incorrect, the user is prompted to try again.
If correct, the challenge is considered completed, and the user is allowed to access the locked app.
The app tracks "sessions" - once a challenge is completed for an app, the user can continue using that app without facing another challenge until they exit the app or switch to another app.
When the user exits the app or switches to a different app and later returns, a new challenge will be presented.
The user can modify their list of locked apps at any time through the main interface.

How complex should the cognitive challenge be?
It never changes, but it should be sufficiently complex to stall the user for 2 or 3 seconds and force them to think a bit. The previously described 'two-faceted stroop challenge' should be sufficient.
