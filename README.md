**str00py** is a productivity app that aids in mindful scrolling. It allows the user to select applications to lock behind a two-faceted stroop challenge, ensuring you engage your brain for at least one second before you can access the app.

The app presents the user with a color word, like "Blue", but displays it in a different color, such as red. Below this are several buttons, each showing a color word in a mismatched color (e.g. "Red" in yellow). To pass the challenge, the user must select the button that matches the display color of the original word, fighting the urge to pick the one that matches the word itself.

- Currently experiencing erratic behaviour (e.g. lock appears to engage 'randomly')
- As above, "session logic" is likely poorly implemented and inconsistent. The first time you lock an app works, but shortly into the "session" the lock re-engages when it's "not supposed to."
- "Answer buttons" are not rendering in a colour that is 'user-friendly' and easily visible. (e.g. "Pink" answer text is too hard to read against the gray background."

- Prettier and more dynamic UI.
- Accessibility features (colourblindness themes, alternate stroop tests such as shape and word matching)
- Non-English localization
- Thorough testing on an array of Android models and builds.
